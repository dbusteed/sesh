# SeSH

Small command line program for managing SSH sessions

<br>

## Setup

* ### Linux / MacOS
    1. `git clone https://github.com/dbusteed/sesh`
    1. `chmod +x sesh`
    1. add the project directory to your PATH, or move `sesh` to some `bin/` folder that is already on your PATH
    1. run the `sesh` command

* ### Windows
    1. `git clone https://github.com/dbusteed/sesh`
    1. add the project directory to your PATH, or move `sesh.ps1` to a folder that is already on your PATH
    1. you might need to allow your PowerShell to run foreign scripts
    1. run the `sesh.ps1` command

<br>

## Usage / Help

After running the script, enter `h` to view the help menu

<br>

## Notes

The bash version of the script is probably more developed than the PowerShell one, since that's where I spend most of my time

<br>

## Future Additions

* Add a similar script to `sesh` integrates `scp` with your sessions
* Add option in the `sesh` command so you can call a session quickly (ex: `sesh 5`)
